            <p>My Portfolio website is my main project. This website provides an overview about myself, my skills and my key projects. I have truly enjoyed working on this project as it gave me the possibility to develop something from scratch, by leveraging nearly all methodologies I have learned so far.</p>
            <p>The website design was built by using Adobe XD and images were edited in Photoshop. I have developed the website through a range of different languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JS) and SASS.</p>

          <p class="tools">Tools/languages: HTML, CSS, JS, SASS, Photoshop and Adobe XD</p>
          <p>As one of my favorite hobbies is playing a game of padel with my friends, developing a website for our team was a great opportunity for me to start building my front-end skills.</p>
          <p>When browsing through the website, you can find the team ranking, the overview of the courts that are booked for the upcoming period and the overview of sets ended with a bagel, a 6-0 set. As it is important that the users can access the booked courts and other data at any moment, the website is mainly intended for use through the smartphone and therefore developed based on the Mobile-First approach.</p>
          <p>Similarly as with my portfolio website, I leveraged a broad range of my front-end and UI/UX skills. I have designed the website with Adobe XD and Photoshop, and developed it with HTML, CSS, JS and SASS.</p>

          <p class="tools">Tools/languages: HTML, CSS and JS</p>
          <p>I have completed a number of projects using my accumulated knowledge about JS, including a task list, number guesser, loan calculator, etc.</p>
          <p>One example that I would like to highlight is a task list. This application allows you to insert a new task which will be added to the list below. When tasks are added to the list, you can delete items from the list or clear the whole list. When a user fills in a task without a value, a message will appear prompting the user to fill in a task. For this project, localStorage is utilized to remember the task list. This way, you can continue working on the task list when the application is reopened.</p>

          <p class="tools">Tools: Adobe XD and Photoshop</p>
          <p>During a course about UX design essentials, I have designed a webshop for “Maynooth”, a furniture store. The project entailed the development of a mockup, which was created with a given description of a persona in mind. Most of the work was performed in Adobe XD, in combination with Photoshop for the editing of images.</p>
          <p>Specifically for this website, I have created custom icons with Adobe XD, which were implemented in the mockup. To make this mockup interactive, prototypes or wires were utilized and micro interactions were used to create interactivity on the page itself.</p>
          <p>During this project, I also got accustomed to the UX process and the different steps, including the user testing.</p>
